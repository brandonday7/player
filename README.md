## Music Player

#### This is a sample application for playing songs using ReactPlayer

This app is meant to:

1. Have pause/play capabilities
2. Display the current track details
3. Allow to switch to next or previous track
4. Have a slider to seek different parts of the track
5. Be styled and fixed to the bottom of the screen

To get started:

```
git clone git@github.com:brandonday7/player.git
npm install --save
npm start
```

Then, go to http://localhost:3000 and you should see a screen like this:
